# [DS Basics | Project sample] Satellite Images Of Ships
This project is a example of basic data science project.

#### - Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Objective
The Airbus Ship Detection Challenge aims to develop advanced machine learning solutions for accurately detecting and classifying ships in satellite imagery. This technology has the potential to bolster maritime security, protect marine ecosystems, and improve trade efficiency, contributing to a safer and more sustainable future for our oceans and society.
### Methods Used
* Semantic Segmentation
* Undersampling
* Augmentation
* etc.

### Technologies
* Python 3.9
* Pandas, Dast
* Numpy, Scipy
* Tensorflow 2.12.0

## Project Description
**Data Sources:** The project relies on a comprehensive dataset of satellite images, provided by Airbus, encompassing a wide range of maritime environments.

**Modeling Work:** Deep learning model, such as U-Net, is being utilized to tackle the ship detection challenge. These models are fine-tuned and optimized to achieve high IoU.

**Blockers and Challenges:** The project faces several challenges, including the need to handle a large volume of data effectively, ensuring model generalization across diverse maritime environments, resolving imbalanced data issue, and addressing computational resource limitations for training and inference.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).
2. Raw Data is being kept [here].

3. Data processing/transformation scripts are being kept [here](Repo folder containing data processing scripts/notebooks)
4. etc...

*If your project is well underway and setup is fairly complicated (ie. requires installation of many packages) create another "setup.md" file and link to it here*  

5. Follow setup [instructions](Link to file)
